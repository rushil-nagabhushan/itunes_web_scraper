This is a hobby / side project that I created. My reason for creating it
was because I ran out of new music to listen to in my ITunes playlist, and
wanted to discover new songs by referring to ITunes Hot 100 songs every day.
I added on the sing-along aspect to add some more purpose to this project.

How it works:
1. scraper.py contains all the core functions necessary for scraping the ITunes Hot 100 Daily page
   and searching for specific songs on Youtube. This function also outputs a list of all the songs
   in order, which is a key data structure within the scope of this project.
2. app.py contains the Flask web interface    that allows the user to interact with the program through
   button click and text entry input for song selection.
3. Once the user inputs a random button click or a text entry, the designated app route will take control,
   process the request appropriately, and return to the original HTML page.

How to use it:
1. Ensure that you have all the necessary Python packages downloaded.
2. Clone or fork the repo locally.
3. Run it on localhost (for now, currently exploring other hosting alternatives)
4. Enjoy your stress-relieving musical experience!

Planned updates:
1. Hosting the app on a permanent service instead of just localhost.
2. Beautifying the overall look and layout of the app using more HTML and CSS.
3. Exploring and implementing different kinds of functionality for the app.
